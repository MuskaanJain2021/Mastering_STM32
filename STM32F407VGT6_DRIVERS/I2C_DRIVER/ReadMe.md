# I2C Driver for  STM32F407VGT6 

 This project provides an I2C driver for STM32 microcontrollers, enabling communication between the microcontroller and I2C-compatible devices. The driver includes support for both master and slave modes, as well as error handling and DMA integration.

## Features

- I2C Clock Control: Enables and disables the I2C peripheral clock.
- I2C Initialization: Configures GPIO pins and sets the I2C operating mode (master/slave).
- I2C Start and Stop Conditions: Implements the necessary protocols to start and stop I2C communication.
- I2C Addressing: Supports writing to a specified I2C address with read/write direction.
- Data Transmission: Facilitates master transmission and slave data reception.
- Error Checking: Provides functionality to check for I2C error statuses.
- DMA Support: Allows for DMA configuration to enhance data transmission efficiency.
- Bus Status Checking: Checks if the I2C bus is currently busy.
- Acknowledgment Configuration: Configures acknowledgment settings for I2C communication.
- Reset Functionality: Resets the I2C configuration to default settings.

## Execution Process

1. Compile the Driver: Use the provided Makefile to compile the driver code.
2. Initialization: Initialize the I2C peripheral with the desired configuration.
3. Perform I2C Operations: Execute the desired I2C operations (e.g., read, write).
4. Check for Errors: Monitor for any error statuses during communication.
5. Clean Up: Disable the I2C clock and reset the configuration if necessary.
